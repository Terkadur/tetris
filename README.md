# Tetris Artificial Intelligence
In this program, I recreated the game, Tetris, and developed an AI to play the game.
I created this project in order to practice my JavaScript programming skills, and learn about how to create an artificial intelligence.
This program is configurable in many ways. For example, it can allow players to play the game, which is done by switching the boolean "ai_active" to false. Otherwise, an artificial intelligence is set to play the game. Additionally, a natural selection algorithm can be used to train the AI to learn how to play Tetris from scratch, which is done by switching the boolean "natural_selection" to true. Otherwise, the AI is a clone of the most effective AI found through my testing of the natural selection algorithm.

This program is written in JavaScript and utilizes the p5.js library, which provides numerous convenient functions for drawing to the screen, storing tables of data, and more.
The [p5.js reference page](https://p5js.org/reference/) was used extensively to determine how to use specific functions. Additionally, a YouTube channel called (Code Bullet)[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0e3QhIYukixgh5VVpKHH9Q] was used for inspiration for this project. I used one of his tutorials to learn how to create a natural selection algorithm, and I watched his videos on his Tetris AI to help determine what variables my AI should take into account. It should be noted that none of his own code or algorithms was used in this project.
From testing the natural selection algorithm, it was determined that it is difficult for the AI to find the right combination of coefficients (which determine the AI's decision making) to get the most effective AI, and large population sizes are important to get a wide enough variety of combinations. Also, the skill of an AI is not directly related to the score that it will reach during any given playthrough, since the sequence of given blocks are completely randomized. Instead, the skill of an AI is related to its probability of losing at any particular instant. For example, the best observed AI was once able to reach a score of over 10 million, but that same AI would later only reach a couple million due to random chance. Also, I attempted to allow the user to upload previous natural selection data to give the program a head start in training the AI, but I was unable to resolve the bugs related to the p5.js function.
I do not believe there are any additional dependencies that must be installed before using this program. The p5.js library is provided in the "libraries" folder, the JavaScript files can be edited using any normal text editor, and the program can be run by opening the "index.html" file in a web browser.
